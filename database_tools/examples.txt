To start a job that processes the ENA files and builds a tab file that can be imported into the database, the
following command can be used:

    # builddb.pl -dir BUILD_DIR -ena-dir ENA_DIR -build-ena -queue efi -scheduler slurm -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE

This could be triggered at the end of the script that downloads (rsync) the ENA files from biomirror.



To create a script that can be used for downloading the requisite files:

    # builddb.pl -dir BUILD_DIR -download -queue efi -scheduler slurm -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE



To create and submit scripts that will process the downloaded files:

    # builddb.pl -dir BUILD_DIR -queue efi -scheduler slurm -db-name YYYY-MM -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE


To create a script and SQL file that will create the family_counts table that needs to be imported into the
EFI webserver mysql database:

    # builddb.pl  -dir BUILD_DIR -build-counts -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE

All scripts are created in BUILD_DIR/build
