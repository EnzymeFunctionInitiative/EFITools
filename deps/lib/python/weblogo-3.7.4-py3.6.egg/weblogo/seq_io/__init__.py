Sequence file reading and writing
---------------------------------

Biological sequence data is stored and transmitted using a wide variety of
different file formats. This package provides convenient methods to read and
write several of these file fomats.

WebLogo is often capable of guessing the correct file type, either from the
file extension or the structure of the file::

>>> import weblogo.seq_io
>>> afile = open("test_weblogo/data/cap.fa")
>>> seqs = weblogo.seq_io.read(afile)

Alternatively, each sequence file type has a separate module named FILETYPE_io
(e.g. fasta_io, clustal_io)::

>>> import weblogo.seq_io.fasta_io
>>> afile = open("test_weblogo/data/cap.fa")
>>> seqs = weblogo.seq_io.fasta_io.read(afile)

Sequence data can also be written back to files::

>>> fout = open("out.fa", "w")
>>> weblogo.seq_io.fasta_io.write(fout, seqs)

    table_io            table           tbl         yes  yes    none


Each IO module defines one or more of the following functions and variables:

read(afile, alphabet=None)
    Read a file of sequence data and return a SeqList, a collection
    of Seq's (Alphabetic strings) and features.

read_seq(afile, alphabet=None)
    Read a single sequence from a file.

iter_seq(afile, alphabet =None)
    Iterate over the sequences in a file.

index(afile, alphabet = None)
    Instead of loading all of the sequences into memory, scan the file and
    return an index map that will load sequences on demand. Typically not
    implemented for formats with interleaved sequences.

write(afile, seqlist)
    Write a collection of sequences to the specifed file.

write_seq(afile, seq)
    Write one sequence to the file. Only implemented for non-interleaved,
    headerless formats, such as fasta and plain.

example
    A string containing a short example of the file format

names
    A list of synonyms for the file format. E.g. for fasta_io, ( 'fasta',
    'pearson', 'fa'). The first entry is the preferred format name.

extensions
    A list of file name extensions used for this file format. e.g.
    fasta_io.extensions is ('fa', 'fasta', 'fast', 'seq', 'fsa', 'fst', 'nt',
    'aa','fna','mpfa').  The preferred or standard extension is first in the
    list.


Attributes :
   * formats: Available seq_io format parsers
   * format_names:  A map between format names and format parsers.
   * format_extensions: A map between filename extensions and parsers.
